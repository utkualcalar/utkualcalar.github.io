  We propose <strong>PnP-CM</strong>, a plug-and-play diffusion solver that reinterprets consistency models (CMs) as proximal operators of a prior, enabling fast and flexible inverse problem solving. Built on PnP-ADMM with conjugate gradient acceleration, PnP-CM further introduces noise injection and momentum for improved convergence while preserving stability. Applied to inpainting, super-resolution, deblurring, and MRI reconstruction, <i>including the first CM trained on MRI datasets</i>, PnP-CM achieves high-quality reconstructions in as few as 4 NFEs and produces meaningful results in just 2 steps, outperforming existing CM-based solvers.
