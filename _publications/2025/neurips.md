  We propose <strong>CUPID</strong>, a physics-driven deep learning (PD-DL) method that trains fast MRI reconstruction models using only routine clinical images, without requiring raw k-space data. CUPID leverages compressibility-based quality measures and perturbation-driven consistency with clinical parallel imaging to enable high-quality reconstructions. Experiments show CUPID achieves quality comparable to k-space–based PD-DL methods and surpasses compressed sensing and diffusion approaches, while enabling zero-shot training for retrospective and prospective sub-sampling. By removing the need for raw data, CUPID broadens access to advanced MRI acceleration techniques, particularly for rural and underserved populations.
