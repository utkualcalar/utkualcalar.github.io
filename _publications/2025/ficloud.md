   We propose a physics-driven AI (PD-AI) reconstruction framework optimized for FPGA-based edge computing to address the massive data demands of high-resolution MRI. Our approach leverages 
   8-bit complex quantization and eliminates redundant FFT/IFFT operations, improving hardware efficiency without sacrificing reconstruction quality. Results demonstrate performance comparable to 
   conventional PD-AI methods and superior to standard clinical techniques, enabling high-resolution MRI on resource-constrained devices.
