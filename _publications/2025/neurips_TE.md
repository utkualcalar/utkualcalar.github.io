  We propose a time-embedded algorithm unrolling framework for MRI reconstruction that integrates iteration-dependent proximal operations and data fidelity weights inspired by AMP and diffusion models. 
  By embedding iteration indices into the proximal network and fidelity parameters, our method reduces artifacts and noise while avoiding parameter growth from using distinct networks. 
  Experiments on the fastMRI dataset show state-of-the-art performance across acceleration rates, and the time-embedding strategy further enhances existing unrolling methods without added complexity.
