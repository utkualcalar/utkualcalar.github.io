   We propose Zero-shot Adaptive Diffusion Sampling (<strong>ZADS</strong>), a self-supervised test-time optimization framework that adaptively tunes data fidelity weights at irregular timesteps without retraining.
   Unlike our earlier ZAPS method for natural image restoration, which used all acquired measurements, ZADS is tailored for large-scale inverse problems where stronger CG-based updates risk overfitting, motivating
   hold-out masking. On the fastMRI knee dataset, ZADS achieves state-of-the-art by outperforming recent diffusion-based methods, delivering high-fidelity reconstructions across varying noise schedules and
   acquisition settings.
