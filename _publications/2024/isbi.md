  We propose a convex loss function for training physics-driven deep learning (PD-DL) models in fast MRI reconstruction, inspired by statistical image processing and compressed sensing. The loss 
  evaluates image compressibility with a reweighted â„“1 norm while enforcing data fidelity, enabling supervised, unsupervised, and zero-shot training. 
  PD-DL networks trained with this formulation outperform conventional methods and achieve quality comparable to existing supervised and unsupervised approaches.
